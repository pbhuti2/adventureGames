OBJECTIVE
The main objective is to create a MadLib Generator
1) We will need to make a function that takes input from the user. 
This should have parameters of what is needed(verb, noun, etc.). 
Their input will have to be stored somewhere
2) We will need to store a MadLib into a variable
3) We will need to prompt the user for each noun, verb, etc.
4) We will need to put all of the users inputs into the MadLib
5) We will need to print the MadLib for the user to read
